# Heart-Disease-Prediction
#  Heart Disease Prediction

A simple machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data.

##  Objective
Use classification algorithms to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

##  Dataset
The dataset contains medical records of patients with features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- GeneralHealth
- PhysicalActivities
- PhysicalHealthDays
- And more...

##  Models Used
- Suport Vector Machine (SVM)

##  Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score


##  How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install required libraries (e.g. `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`)
3. Open the notebook: `heart-disease-prediction.ipynb`
